## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Floodplain Modeling
Introduces the importance of floodplain modeling for managing flood risks. Explains the impacts of floods on communities and ecosystems, and outlines the role of hydrodynamic models. Perfect for beginners learning why flood modeling matters.

### Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Hydrodynamic Modeling
Covers the physics of water flow, including shallow water equations, mass conservation, and momentum. Introduces 1D and 2D modeling approaches in simple terms, providing the foundation for tools like LISFLOOD-FP.

### Chapter 3: Data Requirements for Floodplain Models
Details the essential data for flood modeling, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), river discharge, and Manning’s roughness. Discusses data sources (e.g., LiDAR) and challenges like data gaps, with tips for preparation.

### Chapter 4: One-Dimensional (1D) Hydrodynamic Models
Explores 1D models like MIKE 11, which focus on river channel flow. Covers their simplicity, speed, and limitations for complex floodplains, with comparisons to 2D models.

### Chapter 5: LISFLOOD-FP
Focuses on LISFLOOD-FP, a powerful 2D model. Explains its raster-based approach, solvers (e.g., inertial, diffusive), and setup for small projects. Includes guides for using version 8.1’s GPU acceleration and subgrid channel modeling.

### Chapter 6: Two-Dimensional (2D) Hydrodynamic Models
Discusses 2D models like MIKE 21 and CityCAT, which simulate water flow across floodplains. Compares their strengths and computational demands to 1D models and LISFLOOD-FP.

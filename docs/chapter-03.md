## Culvert Vulnerability Assessment Application

The **Culvert Vulnerability Assessment App** is a comprehensive geospatial tool designed to evaluate the hydrologic and hydrogeomorphologic vulnerability of culverts and related infrastructure. It integrates watershed delineation, hydrologic analysis, and terrain-based assessment methods to support infrastructure planning, disaster resilience, and environmental safety.

### Application Overview

The CULVERT application serves as an integrated platform for engineers, hydrologists, and environmental planners to:

- Identify potential undersizing in existing culvert infrastructure
- Prioritize maintenance and replacement projects based on vulnerability metrics
- Model the impacts of changing climate conditions on infrastructure resilience
- Support evidence-based decision-making for infrastructure investments

The application follows a modular architecture, allowing users to perform analyses independently or in sequence for comprehensive assessment.

## 1. Watershed Delineation

This module allows users to delineate watershed boundaries and stream networks based on elevation data and infrastructure locations such as culverts, bridges, and fords.

### 🧭 Steps in Watershed Delineation

1. **Boundary Region (Mandatory)**

   - Input type: `.zip` (shapefile) or `.shp`
   - Defines the outer limits of the study region.
   - Used as a mask to restrict processing to the area of interest.

2. **DEM Data Raster (Mandatory)**

   - Input type: `.tif`
   - Digital Elevation Model is used for flow direction and accumulation analysis.
   - Recommended resolution: 10m or finer for accurate delineation.
   - Supported vertical datums: NAVD88, NGVD29, or other local datums with proper metadata.

3. **Pour Point Data (Optional)**

   - Examples: Culverts, bridges, fords, or any outlet points.
   - Input format: Shapefile (point) or CSV with X/Y coordinates.
   - Enhances precision in delineating watershed boundaries to real-world infrastructure.
   - Snap distance parameter: Controls how far pour points can be moved to match the stream network.

4. **Stream Delineation Parameters (Mandatory)**

   - **Flow accumulation threshold**: Determines the drainage area required to form a stream (cells or area units).
   - **Minimum stream length**: Filters out short stream segments (in map units).
   - **Stream ordering method**: Strahler, Shreve, or Horton classification systems.
   - **Stream density factor**: Controls the density of the generated stream network.

5. **Hydro-Enforcement Parameters (Optional)**
   - **Sink filling method**: Simple fill, cut-and-fill, or impact reduction algorithm.
   - **Stream burning depth**: Vertical adjustment applied to known stream locations.
   - **Depression breaching**: Method to ensure flow connectivity through artificial barriers.
   - **Culvert insertion method**: Manual or automatic integration of known drainage structures.
   - **Bridge enforcement**: Special handling of flow paths at bridge locations.

### Advanced Delineation Options

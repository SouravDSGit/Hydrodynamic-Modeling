```

## Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you use the project effectively:

### Concept 1: Data Processing

```{glossary}
Data Pipeline
   A series of processing steps that transform raw data into useful information.

Batch Processing

### Concept 2: Configuration

You can configure the system using YAML files:

```yaml
# config.yml
project:
  name: "My Project"
  version: "1.0.0"

settings:
  debug: true
  threads: 4

database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
